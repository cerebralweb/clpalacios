              <p>A novel is a chain of scenes. This definition is true but insufficient.</p>
              
              <p>A novel is a story of a hero who wants to solve a problem, surf a landscape of trouble and obstacle, fight
                all the time against the main villain, and at last, conquer poetic justice. A scene mirrors this at a smaller scale (
                  In other words, a novel is a fractal made out of scenes: an scene of scenes). 
              </p>           
          
    
              
              <h2>Conflict, Action, and Reaction</h2>
              
              <p>It makes sense that a scene is <strong>a conflict related to a goal</strong>. </p>
              
              <p>Although a scene has the same structure as a novel (problem, conflict, and resolution), it represents a
                specific stage in its development. The function of any scene is to advance the story (o <b>to delay the climax</b>.)
              </p>
              
              <p>How do scenes accomplish the delightful delay a reading should be? <strong>Action and reaction</strong>. Once you
                set the goal and the participants, the scene stars with one dazzling event. The consequences could be of any
                kind: <b>physical actions, dialog</b>. You shouldn't include introspections because they
                slow the pace: <dfn><strong>scenes --understood as action-- are to develop events rather than to reason about the plot.</strong></dfn></p>
              
              <p><b>Scenes take over 75% of the story</b>. The rest is for different forms of narration to help readers
                understand what's going on and let them rest off the drama tornados: small and spread chunks of context and introspection.</p>
              
              <p><i>From the readers' viewpoint</i>, scenes start with action, but <i>from the writer's viewpoint,</i> they
                start before (with a short description, the writer organizes the narrative settings; this <b>preparation</b> allows the
                reader to know meaningful information beforehand.)</p>
              
              <dfn><p><strong>The scene begins when its goal emerges. </strong> The reader must feel this is exciting because it anticipates
                conflict between the hero and an antagonist.</p></dfn>
              
              <p>There are three golden rules: 1) follow an order, 2) <b>avoid slowing the pace</b>, and 3) the protagonist
                never stays the same.</p>
              
              <p>A scene is a conscious vertigo. The writer only can implement <b>one viewpoint</b> (shifting would imply
                slowing the pace to adapt the reading to the new perspective).</p>
              <p>The order that rules the timeline in a scene is the same as the three acts in a novel -start, development,
                and end, and it develops a dramatic goal.</p>
              
              <h2>The Role of Scenes in a Novel</h2>
              
              <p>The scene should bring about <b>setbacks</b> that cast more trouble in the road and advance the story. A
                setback could be weak (arising new situations and new doubts) or strong (turning points that occur a few times in the
                novel). The setbacks are <b>derived from the protagonistâs own efforts</b> (Chester); he must deserve what happened
                (otherwise, it is just bad luck, boring.) </p>
                
              <p>Delaying the climax of a novel is like plucking a flower: you have to remove one by one the heroâs options
                until he has no choice but to face the villain in the climax. For that reason, each scene must <b> remove one of those
                  options</b>.</p>

                  <h2>Scenes that make sense for the reader</h2>

                  <p>Emotionally scenes require internalization, so characters actions make sense for the reader. <b>Internalizations
                      should go before Action</b> Reaction pairs to avoid slowing the pace and to prepare the course of action.</p>
                  
                  <p>Internalizations follow an order: <b>sensing (seeing, hearing, smelling, hurting), emotion, thoughts, Action</b>, and
                    Reaction.</p>
                  
                  <p>Once you understand why the stakes matter to each participant in ths scene, you can write a compelling conflict. Hence, knowing
                    the <b>motivations of the parts is crucial:</b> how does achieving the goal or thwarting the hero's purpose fits into
                    each one?</p>

                  <h2>Timeline of Scene</h2>
                  
                  <ul>
                  <li>Preparation: narrative settings</li>
                  <li>One goal related to the plot</li>
                  <li>One viewpoint</li>
                  <li>Two central characters</li>
                  <li>Chains of action and reaction</li>
                  <li>Setbacks </li>
                  <li>Option removed</li>
                  <li>Post scene: sequel</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h2>How to Write Good Sequels</h2>
                  
                  <dfn><p>Sequels are moments to digest what has happened in the previous scene. Readers need them to gain a sense of rhythm.
                    They may feel the book has a systematic arrangement of stages, each with its own traits, so instead of a recurrence of
                    repeated elements, there is an alluring variation. As music, such a cadence demands fast and slow velocities.
                    <b>Sequels are the moments to slow</b> the pace. They must be short and should contribute to solving doubts and
                    mysteries, <b>shed light on character evolution</b>, and make decisions.</p></dfn>

                  <p>In sequels, the protagonist, along with other characters -possibly a confidant, mulls over what has happened and
                    makes decisions. The storytelling follows a sequence: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>emotional aftermath, </li>
                    <li>analysis</li>
                    <li>decision</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Despite that, the writer can defer any of these steps, but the sequence is mandatory (if you omit analysis, for
                    example, the next step is a decision). Two good reasons to<b> delay a sequel are to heighten suspense or keep the pace
                      fast</b>. If you withhold a sequel, you can come back further by saying <i>Meanwhile, in the spaceship.</i></p>
                  
                  <p>Sequels are good moments <b>to switch viewpoints.</b> Therefore, most of them may be placed at the end or the
                    beginning of a chapter.</p>
                  
                  <p>When a character is doing an analysis as a part of a sequel, a rule of thumb is that <b>self-pity tears apart the
                      reader's sympathy </b>for the heroine (Chester).</p>

                  <h2>How to Write the Big Scene</h2>
                  
                  <dfn>
                    <p>The Big Scene is the climax, the moment to fall into the worst moment and face the Villain in the final
                      battle. After some backlashes, the hero wins and solves the main problem in the adventure. Moreover, this experience
                      is so meaningful for the hero that he undergoes a profound change <b>(he solves an internal conflict </b>significant
                      in the story). After reading it, people must feel fulfilled because there were poetic justice and answers to all the
                      meaningful questions. Remember: We want to read fantasy, see the hero get it right, and experience the power of magic,
                      for the real world is mundane.</p>
                  </dfn>
                  
                  <p>Some typical elements in the Big Scene are:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>5,000</li>
                    <li>The foundation is the <b>anticipation</b></li>
                    <li><b>Hope and despair</b> (contradictory cues)</li>
                    <li>a startling <b>surprise beyond anything</b> expected</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>However, contemporary readers have shorter spans of attention which favors <b>Clusters of
                      Scenes</b> (with no reaction in between) rather than a big scene. With enough urgency, it may feel like a big scene.
                  </p>

                  <p>Constraints of a good climax</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your storyâthe heart of any novelâ lies<b> inside your protagonist</b>. All the events are happening
                      to <b>force your protagonist to confront her internal problem</b> and fix it.</li>
                    <li>The story needs a central question that can be answered at the end with <b>a simple yes or
                        no</b> without muddled explanations.</li>
                    <li>You have created a protagonist with <b>a driven style</b>. She learns from her setbacks, evolves, and
                      gets stronger.</li>
                    <li>You set a<b> bond between the start and the end.</b> (the short story). (One way to fix an issue here
                      is rewriting the inception and the conclusion, just re-plotting the rest) </li>
                    <li>In the end, you <b>attack the fundamental inner flaw</b> of the protagonist,<b> force it to the
                        surface</b>, and make it the key to whether she solves the main question.</li>
                    <li>Climax requires obligatory scenes, ethical equations, climax construction, and resolution.</li>
                    <li><b>A high price (a sacrifice </b>based on the worst fear or the most beloved object.)</li>
                    <li>The obligatory scene is a resolution of the principal subplot.</li>
                    <li><b>Self-revelation</b>: the protagonist understands how she has been wrong.</li>
                    <li>If the difficulty perplexes you as a writer, you can be sure youâre on the right track.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Climax steps:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The hero is <b>cornered</b>: a big confrontation is inevitable.</li>
                    <li>A <b>sacrifice</b>: The villain imposes a choice, and any alternative looks bad: a moral or ethical
                      dilemma. </li>
                    <li>Antagonist hard backslash.</li>
                    <li>The dark moment: don't rush it. Use it to reveal the protagonist's inner "nature". That is <b>the
                        condition to change</b>. At the start, external change propels the hero into adventure (because he does
                      everything to avoid change); at the end, she will conquer an internal change to wrap up the story.</li>

                    <li>A worthy protagonist will win.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>Fantasy readers develop strong expectancies over the plot, and want to reach the conclusion eagerly (on
                    the contrary, what Science Fiction readers enjoy the most is the process). The core tool for the expected Big Scene is
                    <b>anticipation, </b>the action of introducing a part of what will happen in the end: you make up a clue and put it in
                    a previous scene. Examples:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Kings' tax collector is coming and putting pressure over town's people; this occurs over and over
                      again: sooner or later <i>it's going to be big quarrel.</i></li>
                    <li>Mary feels curious about Merlin's Time Machine. He told her not to touch or even look at it, but she
                      keeps going to the room where the machine is. <i>She's going to have a time travel.</i></li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p> Enough of this and readers will realize that the town will be facing attack unless they flee or pay taxes. When
                    someone decides to stay put, readers will be certain of whatâs coming: a big quarrel against the king.</p>


                  Boring? Not if the writer has built anticipation well. How to do it?
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Build it until readers are<b> anxious</b> for the battle to happen.</li>
                    <li>Let them feel the Big Scene is <b>probable</b> but it's not sure it happens.</li>
                    <li>Expectation is not equal to prediction: don't let readers feel they can predict what will take place.
                    </li>
                    <li>Characters take action in order to be prepared for <i>something.</i></li>
                    <li>There are <b>indicators of the opposite</b> (for example, they've prepared for things that didn't
                      happen.)</li>
                    <li>Anticipation is like to say: take <i>this</i> into consideration, just in case.</li>
                    <li>People has been <i>whispering.</i></li>
                    <li>Don't rush it.</li>
                    <li>Don't say much.</li>
                    <li>Don't be obvious.</li>
                  </ul>
